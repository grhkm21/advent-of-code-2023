# Advent of Code 2023

ChatGPT: Yes, it is that time of the year again. Advent of Code. The time where everyone celebrates, cries, and, against all reason, a few of us (grhkm, guilty as charged) decide it's a brilliant idea to embrace the chaos and wake up at 5 am every day just to dive headfirst into coding challenges and participate in a leaderboard we have no business being on. I mean, who needs a normal sleep schedule when you can have the dubious honor of struggling through algorithmic puzzles in the wee hours of the morning, right?

In the whimsical world of Advent of Code, each day's challenge feels like a personal affront to my coding abilities. It's as if the puzzles are designed to make me question every life decision that led me to this point. And yet, here I am, stubbornly pushing through, armed with a cup of coffee and a questionable sense of self-worth. The forums become my digital confessional, where I share my trials, errors, and the occasional existential crisis with fellow code warriors who are all too familiar with the struggle.

As the competition heats up, the leaderboard mocks me with its unforgiving display of coding virtuosos who make my attempts look like a toddler playing with building blocks. It's both humbling and strangely uplifting, like being the underdog in a movie where you know you're destined to lose but somehow find a way to revel in the absurdity of it all. So, here's to another year of stumbling through Advent of Code, wearing my coding inadequacies like a badge of honor, and embracing the delightful self-deprecating camaraderie of the coding misfits. Here's to the chaos, the laughs, and the joy of being gloriously bad at this. Cheers!

(Just have fun!)
